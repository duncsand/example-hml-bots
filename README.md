# HML bot templates
A selection of HML scripts that do cool or useful things

- [Verify Identity](/verify-identity.hml.yaml) - this bot verifies the user's existing identity via email or sms before it will engage. It sends an email or sms with a special encoded link that must be pressed before the bot will continue.
- [Collect & Verify Identity](/collect-and-verify-identity.hml.yaml) - this bot collects the user's identity and verifies that via email or sms before it will engage. It sends an email or sms with a special encoded link that must be pressed before the bot will continue.
- [OpenAI Classification](/openAI-classification.hml.yaml) - this bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 classification endpoint to determine the intent of a user's input
- [OpenAI Completions](/openAI-completions.hml.yaml) - this bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 completions endpoint to determine if a user's input was positive or negative
- [Hugging Face Zero Shot Classification](/huggingface-zero-shot-classification.hml.yaml) - this bot uses a Hugging Face endpoint to classify a user's input without needing *any* training data!
- [Celebrate](/celebrate.hml.yaml) - this bot celebrates with confetti
- [Let it snow](/let-it-snow.hml.yaml) - this bot makes it snow in chatland
- [Data Collection](/data-collection.hml.yaml) - this bot collects information through a series of questions and forms and stores that information in an event
- [Human Task]() - this bot raises a human tast in the Humanise.AI dashboard
- [Query AirTable](/airtable.hml.yaml) - the source code for our Margate Indie Food Bot uses Air Table as a content store. Airtable makes a great database for a bot and this example shows how to make queries direct from HML to Airtable
- [Entities](/entities.hml.yaml) - our internal entity detection works for amounts of money, credit card numbers, distances, durations, email addresses, numbers, ordinals, phone numbers, quatities, temperatures, dates / times, urls and volumes. This example looks for dates.
